    "📘 Two-Pointer Technique — Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "->The Two-Pointer Technique is an algorithmic method where two variables (pointers) are used to scan through a data structure—usually an array  orlinked list—in a coordinated manner to solve problems efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "->Instead of using nested loops (O(n²)), two pointers often allow solving problems in O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why Two Pointers Work\n",
    "\n",
    "##Two pointers reduce unnecessary work by allowing you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "->compare elements at two positions at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "->move towards the answer in a controlled way\n",
    "\n",
    "->avoid scanning parts of the array multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "->It relies on the idea that moving one pointer forward or backward can help eliminate impossible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ When We Use Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "##Use it when:\n",
    "\n",
    "->Array is sorted\n",
    "(ideal for pair/triplet sum, range checks, merging)\n",
    "\n",
    "->Linked list traversal\n",
    "(cycle detection, middle node, deletion)\n",
    "\n",
    "->Subarray/substring problems\n",
    "(window grows and shrinks)\n",
    "\n",
    "->Optimization problems\n",
    "(max area, minimum length, valid window)\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 Pointer Behaviors (Core Logic)\n",
    "\n",
    "##Two pointers can behave in several fixed patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Opposite Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->One pointer at start\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->One at end\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->Move toward each other\n",
    "       Used for:\n",
    "         ->Two Sum (sorted), 3Sum, Container With Most Water\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Same Direction (Fast–Slow Pointers)\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->Both start together\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->One moves faster\n",
    "         Used for:\n",
    "           ->Cycle detection, middle of linked list, removing nth node\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sliding Window\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->Two pointers represent the start and end of a window\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->Right pointer expands\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->Left pointer shrinks\n",
    "          Used for:\n",
    "            ->Longest substring, subarray problems, frequency control\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dual Pointer Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "     ->Used to combine two sorted arrays/lists\n",
    "\n",
    "      ->Both pointers move only forward\n",
    "         Used for:\n",
    "            ->Merge sorted arrays, intersection of arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "🔧 Key Principles\n",
    "✔️ Move pointers based on conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "    ->Increase left pointer if value is too small\n",
    "\n",
    "    ->Decrease right pointer if value is too big\n",
    "\n",
    "    ->Expand window until condition breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "    ->Shrink window to restore validity\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ No pointer ever moves backward unnecessarily\n",
    "\n",
    "    ->This is what makes the technique linear time.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Works best on monotonic or structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "     ->Like sorted arrays or linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->Time-efficient: Most problems solved in O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "   ->Space-efficient: Uses constant space\n",
    "\n",
    "    ->Avoids nested loops\n",
    "\n",
    "🎓 In One Line (Interview Definition)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Pointers is a technique where two indices traverse a data structure in a coordinated way—either together or from opposite ends—to reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n). It is mainly used in sorted arrays, linked lists, and sliding window problems."
